# Quiz-App
I have created a Quiz Web App using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. When user will open the home page he/she will see a Start Quiz botton onece click on that bottom 
quiz will start. One question appear with four options and a botton at the button named as (Next). Onece user select any option background of the correct option 
will turn green and other options background turn red. if user select the corret answer then background of entire body will turn into green similarly if user select
wrong option then background will turn into red. User can move forward on clicking next botton.
